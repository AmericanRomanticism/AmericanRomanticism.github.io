      <p>Song, Song of the South</p>
      <p>Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth</p>
      <p>Gone, gone with the wind</p>
      <p>There ain't nobody lookin' back again.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Cotton on the roadside, cotton on the ditch</p>
      <p>We all picked the cotton but we never got rich.</p>
      <p>Daddy was a veteran, a Southern Democrat.</p>
      <p>They oughta get a rich man to vote like that.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Song, Song of the South</p>
      <p>Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth</p>
      <p>Gone, gone with the wind</p>
      <p>There ain't nobody lookin' back again.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Well somebody told us Wall Street fell,</p>
      <p>But we were so poor that we couldn't tell.</p>
      <p>The cotton was short, and the weeds was tall.</p>
      <p>But Mr. Roosevelt's a' gonna save us all.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Well momma got sick, and daddy got down,</p>
      <p>The county got the farm, and we moved to town</p>
      <p>Papa got a job with the TVA</p>
      <p>We bought a washing machine, and then a Chevrolet</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Song, Song of the South</p>
      <p>Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth</p>
      <p>Gone, gone with the wind</p>
      <p>There ain't nobody lookin' back again.</p>
      <h4>The chorus, above, repeats for 5 more times.</h4>
