        <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Welcome to the American Romanticism period, a period characterized by transcendentalism and anti-transcendentalism.</p>
        <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Two songs that describe this period are High Cotton and Song of the South, both by the band Alabama. Each song has their own page.</p>
        <p style="font-family:'Arial'">First, let's define two important terms during this time period: Transcendentalism and Anti-Transcendentalism.</p>
        <h4>Transcendentalism</h4>
        <p style="font-family:'Arial'">This philosophy emphasizes living a simple life, celebrating nature, and characterized by personal emotion and imagination.</p>
        <h4>Anti-Transcendentalism</h4>
        <p style="font-family:'Arial'">This philosophy believes that humans have the capacity for evil, used gothic elements such as bizarre situations, demonic and insane depictions, and plots about sin, guilt, madness, among others.</p>
