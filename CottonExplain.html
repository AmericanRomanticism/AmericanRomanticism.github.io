        <p>"Round our house the grass was green,"</p>
        <p>This line is transcendental because it mentions a bit about nature, saying that the grass was green around their house. In context of the song, it means that it was a calming and happy time, much like how Henry David Thoreau was in the Brute Neighbors section of Walden, because usually if grass is green, it's a sign of happiness.</p>
        <p>"Choppin' cotton and pusing plows,"</p>
        <p>This line is transcendental because it describes a life on the farm in the South. Much like pieces in American Romanticism, it describes and emphasizes a simple American life on the farm, much like the essays written by Ralph Waldo Emerson, especially Self-Reliance.</p>
        <p>"And learnin' how to give it all we had."</p>
        <p>This line is transcendental because it emphasizes and describes a simple American life. It is very similar to the essay Self-Reliance by Ralph Waldo Emerson, as it emphasizes self-reliance if they learned how to give it all they had.</p>
        <p>"And felt the love in mamma's hands,"</p>
        <p>This line is transcendental because it displays personal emotion, feeling the love from a mother, similar to how we can infer that Thoreau loved nature in his cabin.</p>
        <p>"Old times there are not forgotten,"</p>
        <p>This line is transcendental because it displays personal emotion and makes the listener feel personal emotion when they listen it. They would never forget their simple life on the farm, and it's similar to feeling depressed that you're leaving a childhood home.</p>
