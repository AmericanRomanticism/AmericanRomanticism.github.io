        <p>We didn't know the times were lean,</p>
        <p>Round our house the grass was green,</p>
          <p>It didn't seem like things were all that bad,</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I bet we walked a thousand miles,</p>
           <p>Choppin' cotton and pusing plows,<p>
        </p>And learnin' how to give it all we had.</p>
        <p> </p>
      <p>As Life went on and years went by,</p>
      <p>I saw the light in daddy's eye,</p>
      <p>And felt the love in mamma's hands,</p>
     <p>They kept us warm and kept us fed,</p>
      <p>Taught us how to look ahead,</p>
         <p>Now lookin' back I understand.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>We were walkin' in high cotton,
      <p>Old times there are not forgotten,</p>
      <p>Those fertile fields are never far away,</p>
      <p>We were walkin' in high cotton,</p>
      <p>Old time there are not forgotten,</p>
          <p>Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.</p>
        <p> </p>
      <p>When Sunday mornings rolled around,</p>
      <p>We dressed up hand-me-downs,</p>
      <p>Just in time to gather with the church,</p>
      <p>Some times I think how long It's been,</p>
      <p>And how it impressed me then,</p>
          <p>It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.</p>
        <p> </p>
      <p>We were walkin' in high cotton,</p>
      <p>Old times there are not forgotten,</p>
      <p>Those fertile fields are never far away,</p>
      <p>We were walkin' in high cotton,</p>
      <p>Old time there are not forgotten,</p>
          <p>Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.</p>
