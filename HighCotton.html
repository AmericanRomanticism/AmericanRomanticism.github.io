        <p style="font-family:'Arial'">We didn't know the times were lean,</p>
        <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Round our house the grass was green,</p>
          <p style="font-family:'Arial'">It didn't seem like things were all that bad,</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p style="font-family:'Arial'">I bet we walked a thousand miles,</p>
           <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Choppin' cotton and pusing plows,<p>
        </p>And learnin' how to give it all we had.</p>
        <p> </p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">As Life went on and years went by,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">I saw the light in daddy's eye,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">And felt the love in mamma's hands,</p>
     <p style="font-family:'Arial'">They kept us warm and kept us fed,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Taught us how to look ahead,</p>
         <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Now lookin' back I understand.</p>
        <p style="font-family:'Arial'"> </p>
        <p style="font-family:'Arial'">We were walkin' in high cotton,
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Old times there are not forgotten,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Those fertile fields are never far away,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">We were walkin' in high cotton,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Old time there are not forgotten,</p>
          <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.</p>
        <p> </p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">When Sunday mornings rolled around,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">We dressed up hand-me-downs,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Just in time to gather with the church,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Some times I think how long It's been,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">And how it impressed me then,</p>
          <p style="font-family:'Arial'">It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.</p>
        <p> </p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">We were walkin' in high cotton,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Old times there are not forgotten,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Those fertile fields are never far away,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">We were walkin' in high cotton,</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Old time there are not forgotten,</p>
          <p style="font-family:'Arial'">Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.</p>
        <h5 style="font-family:'Arial'">This verse above repeats 2 more times. The song ends with "Walkin' in High Cotton."</h5>
