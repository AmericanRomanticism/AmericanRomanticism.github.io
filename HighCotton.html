        <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
        <p>We didn't know the times were lean,
           Round our house the grass was green,
          It didn't seem like things were all that bad,</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I bet we walked a thousand miles,
           Choppin' cotton and pusing plows,
          And learnin' how to give it all we had.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>As Life went on and years went by,
            I saw the light in daddy's eye,
            And felt the love in mamma's hands,
            They kept us warm and kept us fed,
          Taught us how to look ahead,
          Now lookin' back I understand.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>We were walkin' in high cotton,
          Old times there are not forgotten,
          Those fertile fields are never far away,
          We were walkin' in high cotton,
          Old time there are not forgotten,
          Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>When Sunday mornings rolled around,
          We dressed up hand-me-downs,
        Just in time to gather with the church,
        Some times I think how long It's been,
        And how it impressed me then,
          It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>We were walkin' in high cotton,
           Old times there are not forgotten,
            Those fertile fields are never far away,
            We were walkin' in high cotton,
            Old time there are not forgotten,
          Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.</p>
