      <p>"We all picked the cotton but we never got rich."</p>
      <p>This line is transcendental because it describes a simple American life on the farm, similar to what Ralph Waldo Emerson was emphasizing in his essay Self-Reliance.</p>
      <p>"Well momma got sick, and daddy got down,"</p>
      <p>"The county got the farm, and we moved to town"</p>
      <p>These two lines are transcendental because it displays personal emotion. Being evicted from your land would be sad and disappointing, adding on to the depression when the mother got sick. It would remind oneself of The Pond in Winter in Walden by Henry David Thoreau, with his scene looking sad, bland, and disappointing, but he still persevered.</p>
      <p>"We bought a washing machine, and then a Chevrolet"</p>
      <p>This line is transcendental because it displays personal emotion. After being evicted, if you received a washing machine (which you didn't have before) and a new car, you'd feel joy as you would think things are getting better for you.</p>
